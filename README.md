# [Project 1: Housing Sale Price Estimator: Ames, Iowa](https://github.com/jgritmire/Project_1_Housing_Regression)
* Used Numpy and Pandas to clean a dataset of 2,930 observations of 82 variables which detail the physical characteristics of homes sold in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010
* Created data visualizations using Matplotlib to better understand the data set
* Used Scikitlearn to create a multivariate linear regression which was able to predict house pricing with an R2 value of 0.91

# [Project 2: Web Scraping to Predict Social Media Virality](https://github.com/jgritmire/Reddit_Web_Scraper/blob/main/README.md)
* Utilized Selenium and BeatifulSoup to scrape key information on thousands of posts each day from Reddit
* Categorized posts as being image only, text only, or video
* Built a logistic regression that would predict whether a post would be successful based on a number of factors including day posted, time of day, and post content
* Performed data analysis to determine the optimal day, time, and type of post to get the greatest amount of post interaction

# [Project 3: Building a Movie Recommendation Algorithm](https://github.com/jgritmire/Movie_Recommender)
* Compiled relevant information from IMDB to build a dataset of 1.6 million films
* Restricted the dataset to 8,000 films based on popularity, as determined by the number of reviews the film had received
* Scraped Wikipedia for plot synopses for each of the 8,000 films, and used NLP to identify similarities between films
* Built a Python script that takes 3 films that a user likes, and returns a list of 10 recommended films based on cosine similarity scores
