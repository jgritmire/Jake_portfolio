# Project 1: Housing Sale Price Estimator: Ames, Iowa
* Used Numpy and Pandas to clean a dataset of 2,930 observations of 82 variables which detail the physical characteristics of homes sold in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010
* Created data visualizations using Matplotlib to better understand the data set
* Used Scikitlearn to create a multivariate linear regression which was able to predict house pricing with an R2 value of 0.91

# Project 2: Identifying US Counties with High Covid-19 Burden
* Worked with a team using Github to scrape, compiled, and cleaned a Covid-19 dataset which contained 43 Million observations of 34 variables. 
* Consolidated the data at the county level in order to prepare the data for modeling
* Utlized Scikitlearn's LinearRegression package to identify high risk US counties
* Interpreted model coefficients to determine significant contributing factors to Covid Deaths
